# Kotlin_Exercises
Overview
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering Kotlin. Over the next 52 weeks, I will follow a structured plan to build my proficiency in Kotlin, starting from basic concepts and gradually advancing to real-world projects.

Learning Plan

Weeks 1–4: Basic Kotlin Concepts
Focus: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Control Flow, and Functions
•	Week 1: Kotlin Syntax & Variables
o	Day 1: Print "Hello, World!" in Kotlin.
o	Day 2: Declare and print variables of different types (Int, String, Double, Boolean).
•	Week 2: Conditional Statements & Loops
o	Day 1: Check if a number is even or odd.
o	Day 2: Print numbers from 1 to 100, skipping those divisible by 3.
•	Week 3: Functions & Parameters
o	Day 1: Function that takes two integers and returns their sum.
o	Day 2: Function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
•	Week 4: Lists and Iteration
o	Day 1: Sum all elements in a list of integers.
o	Day 2: Remove duplicates from a list of strings.

Weeks 5–8: Intermediate Control Flow and Functions
Focus: Arrays, More Complex Loops, Function Overloading
•	Week 5: Arrays & Indexing
•	Week 6: Loops and Collections
•	Week 7: Function Overloading
•	Week 8: Using when Expression

Weeks 9–12: Intermediate Kotlin Concepts
Focus: Null Safety, Lambdas, Working with Collections
•	Week 9: Null Safety & Safe Calls
•	Week 10: Higher-Order Functions & Lambdas
•	Week 11: Collections & List Operations
•	Week 12: String Manipulation

Weeks 13–16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Focus: Classes, Inheritance, Interfaces, Data Classes
•	Week 13: Basic Classes & Objects
•	Week 14: Inheritance & Overriding
•	Week 15: Interfaces
•	Week 16: Data Classes & Destructuring

Weeks 17–20: Advanced Control Flow and Algorithms
Focus: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Algorithmic Challenges
•	Week 17: Sorting & Searching Algorithms
•	Week 18: Recursion
•	Week 19: Algorithmic Challenges
•	Week 20: More Sorting Algorithms

Weeks 21–24: More OOP & Advanced Concepts
Focus: Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Sealed Classes, Lambda Functions
•	Week 21: Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
•	Week 22: Sealed Classes
•	Week 23: Lambda Expressions
•	Week 24: Mutable & Immutable Collections

Weeks 25–28: Data Processing and More Algorithms
Focus: Collections, Algorithms, Data Structures
•	Week 25: Dynamic Programming Algorithms
•	Week 26: Stacks & Queues
•	Week 27: Linked Lists
•	Week 28: Sorting Algorithms Revisited

Weeks 29–52: Real-World Projects
Focus: Applying Kotlin skills in practical scenarios
•	Weeks 29-32: Console Application (e.g., To-Do App)
•	Weeks 33-36: Command-Line Tool (e.g., File Operations)
•	Weeks 37-40: Text-Based Game
•	Weeks 41-44: Open-Source Contribution
•	Weeks 45-48: Kotlin for Android (optional)
•	Weeks 49-52: Final Major Project (e.g., App or Library)

How to Use This Repository
•	Each week's tasks will be stored in a corresponding folder, identified by that week’s topic.
•	Each day's Kotlin programs will be named descriptively (e.g., hello_world.kt, even_odd_checker.kt).
•	I will commit and push my progress as completed.
•	Code will be stored in different branches based on the section:
  o	basic-kotlin-concepts
  o	intermediate-control-flow-functions
  o	intermediate-kotlin-concepts
  o	object-oriented-programming
  o	advanced-control-flow-algorithms
  o	more-oop-advanced-concepts
  o	data-processing-algorithms
  o	real-world-projects

Tools and Setup
•	Kotlin Version: Latest stable release
•	IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
•	Build System: Kotlin CLI
